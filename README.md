## Suggested Class Activity (10 minutes)

Use this as a guided exercise in class.

1. Set benchmark country to `United States`.
2. Ask each student (or pair) to choose a different country.
3. Students move slider `A` until the app says: **The model matched the data**.
4. Students record:
	- selected country
	- matched `A`
	- whether the country is poorer/richer than benchmark
	- the two counterfactual results shown at the bottom
5. Quick debrief: ask whether capital gaps or productivity gaps seem more important across countries.
